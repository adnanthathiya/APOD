# APOD

**Code Architecture:** 
I have used MVVM coding structure

**Persitance Data Storage:**
I have used CoreData to save presistance data

**Improvement Areas**
- Localisations of messages
- Need to implement concurrency logic for core data operations
- Due to lack of time, not able to write UITests cases.
